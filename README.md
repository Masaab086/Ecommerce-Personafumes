"Personafumes" is a dynamic e-commerce project that I developed using Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js. It features seamless integrations with Stripe, AWS, and Google services, enhancing the platform's functionality and user experience. The project's MySQL database ensures efficient data management, and it has been migrated to a new GitHub account to showcase my expertise in building complex and feature-rich applications for portfolio purposes.
